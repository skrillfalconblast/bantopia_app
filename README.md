# The Proof of Concept app for bantopia

It's linked to the website's API using Django.

It's message functional on iOS, but I have yet to add @mentions and logins from the main site.

(Built with my own custom version of Godot that has a few changes to the way it handles iOS keyboards to make it work properly smoothly, if you need them feel free to ask)

Reasons for using Godot:
- Custom shaders for color invert effect
- Physics for the chatbox
- I wanted to try out a game engine
