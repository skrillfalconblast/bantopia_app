# The Proof of Concept app for bantopia

Built with Godot because I wanted to make a custom shader for the color invert effect, (gif 1 below)

It's linked to the website's API using Django.

It's message functional on iOS, but I have yet to add @mentions and logins from the main site.

(Built with my own custom version of Godot that has a few changes to the way it handles iOS keyboards to make it work properly smoothly, if you need them feel free to ask)
